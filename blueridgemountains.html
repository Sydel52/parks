             <p>The first time I saw the Blue Ride Mountains I was in awe.
             On a clear day the mountains are beautiful with rich colors again the backdrop of the sky.
             The Blue Ridge region is an area steeped in tradition and is recognized worldwide for its natural and cultural richness.
             The Blue Ridge Parkway stretches 469 miles through the region, 
             connecting Great Smoky Mountains National Park with Shenandoah National Park.
             Along the way, the Parkway ties together a diverse landscape and lifestyle--connecting the past 
             with the present and preserving the region's heritage for the future.
