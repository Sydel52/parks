    <p>I would enjoy Mount Rushmore because of the historical factor and natural beauty.  Born and raised in New York City, everything I trip to another state I realize how I appreacite seeing something different and only highrises.  <br>
        The mountatin consist of the profile of four American presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodeore Roosevelt and Abrahm Lincon.</p>
