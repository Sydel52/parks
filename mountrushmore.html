             <p>The first time I saw Mount Rushmore it took my breath away. Former President Obama visited in 2015 and when he first ran for office.
             <p>On a clear day the mountains are beautiful with rich colors again the backdrop of the sky.
             Majestic figures of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln,surrounded
             by the beauty of the Black Hills of South Dakota,tell the story of the birth,growth, development and preservation of this country.
             From the history of the first inhabitants to the diversity of America today,Mount Rushmore brings visitors
             face to face with the rich heritage we all share.
             Nearly three million people visit Mount Rushmore each year. The busiest months are June, July and August. 
             May, September and October are less busy and popular months to visit as well. <br>
